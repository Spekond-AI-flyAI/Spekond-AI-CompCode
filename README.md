# Spekond-AI-CompCode
Spekond-AI Frontend Challenge: Collaborative Angular project to re-engineer a JOC module as part of the Spekond-AI competition. This repo contains all frontend code, specifications, and test cases developed by our team, aimed at delivering a fully automated, high-quality Angular application by the competition deadline.

# Spekond-AI Frontend Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the **Spekond-AI Frontend Challenge**! This repository is dedicated to the development of a re-engineered **JOC module** using **Angular**. As part of the **Spekond-AI competition**, our team will build a high-quality, fully automated Angular-based solution for the module with no manual code changes. The frontend will be designed to work seamlessly with backend APIs built on Spring Boot.
